I thought that&#8217;s pretty cool, but wondered how they did it. First, I logged into my server and tailed the web server log, loaded up my website on my WP7 phone, pinned the page to the home screen using the bottom menu and checked the logs to see if it was re-requesting an iPhone like apple-touch-icon.</blockquote>
