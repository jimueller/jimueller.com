Often a field is inserted into a Word document to indicate the last time the document was updated.  Many times `Todays` date is used for this field, but unfortunately is doesn't accurately reflect the last update since the field will show today's date even when the document is unmodified.  A better indication for last update is the Last Saved date field.

**How to insert the Last Saved date using Word**

1. Insert Ribbon > Quick Parts > Field...
2. Select the 'Date and Time' category
3. Insert the `SaveDate` field
