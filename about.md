## About this site

Baked with [Jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) with a special thanks to:
- [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to make it look good everywhere
- A color theme based on [Solarized by Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) so no one gets eye strain
